# Flight_fare_prediction
### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline, etc!

### This was a fun project as the dataset which I had was categorical and to convert that into meaningful and mapping numerical values took me some time!
### The accuracy on test data is 80 % and train data 95 %
